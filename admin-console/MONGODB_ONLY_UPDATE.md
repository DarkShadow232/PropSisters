# ✅ MongoDB-Only Implementation Complete!

## 🔄 Major Changes

The Admin Console has been **completely refactored** to use **MongoDB for ALL data storage**.

### What Changed:

#### ❌ Removed:
- Firebase Admin SDK
- Firebase Firestore integration
- Firebase Storage for images
- All Firebase-related configuration

#### ✅ Added:
- **Mongoose Models** for all entities:
  - `Rental.js` - Property/rental data
  - `User.js` - User data
  - `Booking.js` - Booking data
  - `Admin.js` - Admin authentication (already existed)

- **Local File Storage**:
  - Images stored in `public/uploads/rentals/`
  - Multer configured for disk storage
  - Unique filenames generated automatically

- **MongoDB as Single Source of Truth**:
  - All CRUD operations use Mongoose
  - Proper relationships with ObjectIds
  - Population of related documents

---

## 📦 What's Now in MongoDB

### Collections:

1. **admins** - Admin user accounts
   - email, password (hashed), name
   - Used for authentication

2. **rentals** - Rental properties
   - title, description, location, address
   - price, bedrooms, bathrooms, amenities
   - images (array of local paths)
   - owner information
   - availability status

3. **users** - Platform users
   - email, displayName, phoneNumber
   - role (user/owner/admin)
   - timestamps

4. **bookings** - Property bookings
   - propertyId (ref to Rental)
   - userId (ref to User)
   - checkIn/checkOut dates
   - guests, totalPrice
   - status (pending/confirmed/cancelled)
   - additional services
   - special requests

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Models (Mongoose Schemas)

All models include:
- Automatic timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt)
- Validation rules
- Data types enforcement
- Pre-save hooks for updates

### Controllers

All controllers now use:
- `await Model.find()` instead of Firebase queries
- `populate()` for related data
- `.lean()` for better performance
- Standard MongoDB query operators

### File Storage

Images are:
- Stored locally in `public/uploads/rentals/`
- Given unique names: `property-{timestamp}-{random}.jpg`
- Served statically via Express
- Deleted from disk when property/image is removed

### Routes

Multer configured for:
- Disk storage (not memory)
- 10MB file size limit
- Image-only filtering
- Automatic filename generation

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Setup (First Time Only)

```bash
cd admin-console
npm install
cp env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:
```env
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/rental-admin
SESSION_SECRET=your-random-secret-here
```

### 2. Start MongoDB

**Local:**
```bash
mongod
```

**Atlas:** Just use your connection string in `.env`

### 3. Create Admin Account

```bash
npm run seed
```

### 4. Start Server

```bash
npm start
```

---

## 📊 Data Management

### Creating Properties

1. Go to Properties → Create New Property
2. Fill in details
3. Upload images (stored locally)
4. Images saved to `public/uploads/rentals/`
5. Paths stored in MongoDB

### Managing Users

- View all users from MongoDB
- See user booking history
- Delete users (removes from MongoDB only)

### Managing Bookings

- View all bookings with filters
- See related property and user data (via populate)
- Update booking status
- Track revenue

## 🔄 Migration Notes

If you had data in Firebase:

1. **Export Firebase Data**
   - Use Firebase Console or Admin SDK
   - Export collections: properties, users, bookings

2. **Import to MongoDB**
   - Use `mongoimport` command
   - Or create a migration script
   - Map Firebase field names to MongoDB schema

3. **Update Image References**
   - Download images from Firebase Storage
   - Place in `public/uploads/rentals/`
   - Update image paths in MongoDB

---

## 💡 Advantages of MongoDB-Only Approach

✅ **Simpler Architecture**
- Single database system
- No need for Firebase setup
- Easier to deploy

✅ **Better Control**
- Full control over data
- Can use MongoDB features directly
- Easier backup and restore

✅ **Cost Effective**
- No Firebase costs
- Can use free MongoDB Atlas
- Or run MongoDB locally

✅ **Standard Stack**
- MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node)
- More familiar to developers
- Easier to find help and resources

✅ **Flexible Querying**
- Use MongoDB aggregation pipeline
- Complex queries easier
- Better performance optimization

## 🗂️ File Structure

```
admin-console/
├── models/
│   ├── Admin.js          ✅ MongoDB
│   ├── Rental.js         ✅ MongoDB (NEW)
│   ├── User.js           ✅ MongoDB (NEW)
│   └── Booking.js        ✅ MongoDB (NEW)
├── controllers/
│   ├── dashboardController.js   ✅ Uses Mongoose
│   ├── propertyController.js    ✅ Uses Mongoose
│   ├── userController.js        ✅ Uses Mongoose
│   └── bookingController.js     ✅ Uses Mongoose
├── config/
│   └── database.js       ✅ MongoDB only
└── public/
    └── uploads/
        └── rentals/      ✅ Local image storage
```

## 📝 Environment Variables

**Before (Firebase + MongoDB):**
```env
MONGODB_URI=...
SESSION_SECRET=...
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH=...
```

**After (MongoDB Only):**
```env
MONGODB_URI=...
SESSION_SECRET=...
```

That's it! Much simpler.
