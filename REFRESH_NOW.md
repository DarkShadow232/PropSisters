### 2. Check Network Tab
- Go to Network tab
- Refresh the page
- Look for the request to `localhost:3000/api/properties`

- Take a screenshot

### 3. Test API Directly
Open this URL in a new browser tab:
```
http://localhost:3000/api/properties
```

You should see JSON data. If you do, the API is working!
