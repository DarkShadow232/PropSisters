# ✅ White Page Issue Fixed!

## 🔧 What Was Fixed:

The problem has been identified and fixed! The issue was that the code was trying to convert MongoDB IDs (strings) to numbers, which was causing React to crash.

### Changes Made:

1. ✅ **Updated RentalDetailsPage.tsx**
   - Removed `Number(id)` which was causing the crash
   - Now passes ID as string correctly

2. ✅ **Updated DetailsHero.tsx**
   - Changed `propertyId` to accept `string | number`

3. ✅ **Updated Reviews.tsx**
   - Changed `propertyId` to accept `string | number`

4. ✅ **Updated reviewsData.ts**
   - Updated all functions to work with MongoDB IDs

5. ✅ **Updated ReviewsList.tsx & ReviewForm.tsx**
   - Updated type definitions to accept `string | number`
