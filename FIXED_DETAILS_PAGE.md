# ‚úÖ Property Details Page Fixed!

## What Was Wrong

When you clicked "Check Availability" or "View Details" on a property card, it showed "Property Not Found" because:

1. The details page was using **static data** from the old `rentalData.ts` file
2. It wasn't fetching property details from the **MongoDB database**
3. MongoDB uses string IDs (`_id`), not number IDs

## What I Fixed

‚úÖ Updated `RentalDetailsPage.tsx` to:
- Fetch property details from MongoDB API using the property ID
- Handle loading state (shows spinner while loading)
- Handle errors (shows error message if property not found)
- Convert MongoDB property format to frontend format

## How to Test

### Step 1: Make Sure Services Are Running

**Admin Console:**
```bash
cd admin-console
npm start
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Test It

1. Go to: http://localhost:8081/rentals
2. Click on any property card
3. You should now see the full property details!

## What You Should See

After clicking a property, you should see:
- ‚úÖ Property images carousel
- ‚úÖ Full description
- ‚úÖ Amenities list
- ‚úÖ Location map
- ‚úÖ Booking calendar
- ‚úÖ Price breakdown
- ‚úÖ Owner information
- ‚úÖ All property details

## Troubleshooting

### Still seeing "Failed to Load Properties" on Browse Rentals page?

The main issue is the **Browse Rentals page isn't loading**. This is a **CORS issue**. Here's how to fix it:

#### Fix 1: Make Sure Admin Console is Running
```bash
cd admin-console
npm start
```

Wait until you see:
```
‚úì MongoDB Connected
Server running on port 3000
```

#### Fix 2: Test the API
Open this URL in your browser:
```
http://localhost:3000/api/properties
```

You should see JSON data with 10 properties.

#### Fix 3: Refresh Frontend
1. Go back to http://localhost:8081/rentals
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (hard refresh)
3. Or click the "Retry" button

## Expected Flow

### Working Flow:
1. **Browse Rentals** ‚Üí Shows all 10 properties from database
2. **Click Property** ‚Üí Shows detailed view with all information
3. **Click "Book Now"** ‚Üí Goes to booking page

### Current Status:
- ‚úÖ Detail page: FIXED (fetches from MongoDB)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Browse page: Needs admin console running on port 3000

---

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Admin Console
cd admin-console
npm start

# Terminal 2: Start Frontend (if not running)
npm run dev
```

Then visit: http://localhost:8081/rentals

- ‚úÖ `src/pages/RentalDetailsPage.tsx` - Now fetches from MongoDB
- ‚úÖ `src/services/mongoPropertyService.ts` - Added fetch by ID function
- ‚úÖ `admin-console/app.js` - Updated CORS settings
