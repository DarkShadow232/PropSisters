# 🔧 Quick Fix for "Failed to Load Properties"

## Issue
Frontend showing "Failed to Load Properties - Failed to fetch"

## ✅ What I Just Fixed

1. **Updated CORS settings** in admin console to accept requests from:
   - `http://localhost:5173` (default Vite port)
   - `http://localhost:8081` (your current port)

2. **Confirmed API is working** - Tested: http://localhost:3000/api/properties ✅

3. **Restarted admin console** with new CORS settings

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Step 1: Wait 5 Seconds
The admin console is restarting with the new settings...

### Step 2: Refresh Your Browser
1. Go back to the rentals page: http://localhost:8081/rentals
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (hard refresh) or click the "Retry" button
3. Properties should now load! 🎉

### Step 3: If Still Not Working

**Open Browser Console** (Press F12):
- Look for any red errors
- Check if it says "CORS" or "Network" error
- Take a screenshot and I can help further

**OR Try These Commands:**

```bash
# Restart admin console manually
cd admin-console
npm start

# Then refresh browser
```

## 🧪 Test the API Directly

Open this URL in your browser to verify the API is working:
```
http://localhost:3000/api/properties
```

You should see JSON data with 10 properties. If you see this → API is working! ✅

---

## 📊 What Should Happen Now

After refreshing your browser, you should see:
- ✅ **10 property cards** displayed
- ✅ Properties load **instantly** (no delays)
- ✅ No more "Failed to Load" error
- ✅ **TEST PROPERTY** is visible

## ⚠️ Still Having Issues?

1. **Make sure admin console is running:**
   ```bash
   cd admin-console
   npm start
   ```

2. **Check the console output for errors**

3. **Test API in browser:**
   - Open: http://localhost:3000/api/properties
   - Should see JSON data

4. **Check browser console (F12):**
   - Look for CORS errors
   - Look for network errors

---

## 🎯 Expected Result

After the fix, your Browse Rentals page should display all 10 properties from the database, including:
1. Premium Two-Bedroom Garden View Apartment
2. Modern Two-Bedroom Apartment, Fifth Floor  
3. Boho-Style Two-Bedroom Apartment
4. Spacious Two-Bedroom Ground Floor Apartment
5. Convenient First Floor Apartment Near Carrefour
6. Luxury Two-Bedroom Apartment with Two Bathrooms
7. Cozy Studio Apartment
8. Spacious Three-Bedroom Garden View Apartment
9. Premium Two-Bedroom Apartment with Hotel-Style Furnishing
10. **TEST PROPERTY - Verify Admin Connection** ⭐

## 💡 Why This Happened

The admin console was only configured to accept requests from `localhost:5173`, but your frontend is running on `localhost:8081`. This caused a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) error.

The fix allows the admin console to accept requests from both ports.

**Now go refresh your browser and the properties should load! 🚀**
