## What Was Fixed

### Problem 1: No Data Showing on Frontend ✅ SOLVED
**Issue:** Properties from the original design weren't in the database  
**Solution:** Created and ran a seed script that added all 9 original properties plus 1 test property to MongoDB

**Result:**
- ✅ 10 properties now in database
- ✅ Properties accessible via API
- ✅ Frontend can fetch and display them

### Problem 2: Slow Loading Times ✅ SOLVED
**Issue:** "Browse Rentals" page had long loading times and hung frequently  
**Solution:** Disabled automatic 30-second polling that was causing performance issues

**Result:**
- ✅ Properties now load instantly
- ✅ No more hanging or delays
- ✅ Manual refresh button available for updates

### Problem 3: Admin-to-Frontend Connection ✅ VERIFIED
**Issue:** Need to verify properties added in admin show on frontend  
**Solution:** Added test property and verified API connection

**Result:**
- ✅ Admin console API working (http://localhost:3000/api/properties)
- ✅ Returns all 10 properties (tested with curl)
- ✅ Frontend configured to fetch from admin console
- ✅ Refresh button available to manually sync
