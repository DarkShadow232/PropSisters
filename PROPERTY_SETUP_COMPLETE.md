# Property Setup Complete! ðŸŽ‰

## What Was Done

### 1. âœ… Database Seeding
Successfully added **10 properties** to the MongoDB database:
- 9 original properties from the frontend design
- 1 test property to verify the admin-frontend connection

### 2. âœ… Performance Optimization
Fixed the slow loading issue on the "Browse Rentals" page:
- Disabled automatic 30-second polling (was causing delays)
- Properties now load instantly on page visit
- Users can manually refresh using the "Refresh" button if needed

### 3. âœ… Admin Console Setup
Created seed scripts for easy database management:
- `npm run seed:properties` - Add the 9 original + 1 test property
- `npm run clear:properties` - Clear all properties from database

## How to Use

### Step 1: Start the Admin Console
```bash
cd admin-console
npm start
```

The admin console will run on: **http://localhost:3000**

### Step 2: Start the Frontend
In a new terminal:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will run on: **http://localhost:5173**

### Step 3: View Properties
Open your browser and visit:
- **Frontend:** http://localhost:5173/rentals
- **Admin Console:** http://localhost:3000/properties

Look for: **"TEST PROPERTY - Verify Admin Connection"**

If you can see this property on the frontend, the connection is working perfectly!

2. Click "Create Property"
3. Fill in the property details
4. Upload images
5. Click "Create"

## Image Paths

All property images are stored in:
- **Frontend:** `/public/image/Apartments/Ap1/` through `/public/image/Apartments/Ap9/`
- **Admin Console:** Images uploaded through admin are stored in `/admin-console/public/uploads/rentals/`

When adding properties via admin console, you can:
1. Upload new images (will be stored in `/uploads/rentals/`)
2. Reference existing images using paths like `/image/Apartments/Ap1/IMG-20250327-WA0010.jpg`
